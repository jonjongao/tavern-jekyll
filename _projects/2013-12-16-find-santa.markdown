ONLY ONE PATH CAN LEAD YOU TO THE GIFT! You are a little girl trying to find Santa's legendary gift! 

Every 30 sec you will get some trail like noise sound(randomly) to show Santa's direction, so is much easily to find out.

During the game jam, I call out my friends help some Gift art, It's very interesting co-op with my friends, put their artwork into my game :D
