Try to hit old Wolfenstein style, and it work out pretty good!

Integration with Game Jolt API, it's super cool to have Leaderboard and Achievement system :D

During the time frame, company got the first Oculus, Since this is 3D FPS Game, I have to jump it, right?

Also surprisingly got some attention from Youtuber, watching people play my own game and suffering, I have a lot of fun time during this Game Jam <3
