3rd interactive album I made in same framework.

Huge different is this album ship with Lossless Compression format, In order to play that high bitrate, I made bunch of tweak to audio reader library, also extra memory managing to stream lossless file.

Funny thing is I don't actually get physical copy of album, So I don't know how it look in final product, But thanks to the community, I saw a lot of positive comments. At least no one has trouble, that's my most concerned :)

Video below is tutorial video made by publisher, you can see they actually made this album in an old school tape case! AWESOME!!!
