Little squirrel trying to survive in dangerous forest. Eat nuts to gain stamina, find Nest to gain addition life.

My very first [Game Maker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) project! also my second [GBJAM](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-5) game. I had a quite fun time in GM!

I was trying to make a [Tokyo Jungle](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/tokyo-jungle/cid=UP9000-NPUA80523_00-TOKYOJUNGLE00001) like, every move is costing stamina, you have to find food and nest, then find companion to make a baby (addition life). generally try to survive in the dangerous forest.

Although a lot of feature is not done yet, but I’ve good time! it’s the first project I actual work with my girlfriend, trying to bring her in you know. and work with new tool you never try it before, that’s the exciting part :D
