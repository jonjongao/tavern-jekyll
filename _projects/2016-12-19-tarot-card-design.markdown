Tarot card design with [Chinese Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagenary_cycle) theme(天干地支).

Because this case has to finish in short amount of time, So I decided to get some help.
In the end I gather 5 of my artist friend which never collaborate with each other before, We have to finish this case of 25 cards in 30 days, and everybody has fulltime job. INTERESTING! RIGHT?

I try to make a workflow which everyone comfortable work with, also had space to unleash their creativity.
Although we still facing some problem during the process, like some artist took too much of subject their can take care of, but because of each flow make pretty clean cut, so it's much easier to move artist to the part it needs help, without breaking the whole pipeline.

ALSO, it's easier to calculate paysheet to each artist :)

The result are, We finished the case 3 days before deadline, happy client, happy artist!
