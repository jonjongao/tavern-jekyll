Story is about little fox on the journey of restore family legacy garden by stamping leaf and collecting seed.

Unlock new tree, plant, feed and grow! 

This's the 2nd project I work with my wife, We experiment random game idea while I teach her 2D game developing process and required knowledge(ex: Making Spritesheet, Important of Sprite pivot, Unify Sprite scale etc.)

Game idea is because my wife like stamping dry leaf, literally that's it :D

So why no make a game out of it, right?
